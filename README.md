# ESA-ESRIN_SNR_Analysis

This repository contains the code of the Signal-to-Noise Ration (SNR) Analysis conducted during my Young Graduate Trainee program at ESA-ESRIN.

It includes an R script indentifying defective files to be excluded from the analysis (SNR_Defective_Files.Rmd) and the core R script performing the SNR Analysis on the hyperspectral 2018 FLEX Campaign data (SNR.Rmd). A sample output is provided in the export folder together with a full list of results.

An SNR Method Validation was conducted, but not uploaded.
